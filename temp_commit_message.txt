Fix: Allow avatar image removal on custom character edit page

This commit implements the functionality to allow users to remove an avatar image from their custom characters, reverting it to the default empty image.

Previously, when a user clicked the "Avatar Reset" button on the character edit page, the frontend would clear the local avatar state but would not send an explicit signal to the backend to remove the existing avatar URL. Consequently, the `avatarUrl` in Firestore remained unchanged, and the character's avatar would not revert to the default upon saving.

This fix introduces the following changes:
- **Frontend (`pages/character/edit/[id].tsx`):**
    - A new `avatarRemoved` state variable tracks explicit avatar removal.
    - The "Avatar Reset" button now sets `avatarRemoved` to `true`.
    - The form submission (`handleSubmit`) now appends `formData.append('avatarRemoved', 'true')` if `avatarFile` is null and `avatarRemoved` is true, signaling the backend to clear the avatar.
- **Backend (`pages/api/profile/characters/[id].ts`):**
    - The API now extracts the `avatarRemoved` field from the incoming form data.
    - If `avatarRemoved` is 'true' and no new `avatarFile` is provided, `updates.avatarUrl` is explicitly set to `null`, effectively removing the avatar from the character's profile in Firestore.
